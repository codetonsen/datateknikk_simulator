# Simulator for SLAM based Rover - University Project
In the course: "Datateknikk for kyberfysiske systemer" my group made a SLAM Rover performing slam with features such as autnomous frontier exploration etc.
To help the development this simulator was built.

## Features:
  - scan simulation
  - threepp testworld
  - gicp frame matching
  - g2o implementation (non working)
